   * The value of this top-level key is an array with the following keys:
   *   -name: this key is not actually used but is available to improve
   *     readability of the array.  Because the key is a vocabulary term
   *     containing only the accession it's not always clear what it means.
   *     Providing a 'name' key helps other's know what the term is.
   *   -searchable:  TRUE if the element can be used for filtering the content
   *     type to which tis field is attached.  FALSE if not.
   *   -operations:  an array of filtering operations that can be used for this
   *     field.  These include: 'eq', 'ne', 'contains', 'starts', 'gt', 'lt',
   *     'gte', 'lte'.  These operations are applicable to strings: 'eq', 'ne',
   *     'contains', and 'starts'.  These operations are applicable for numeric
   *     values: 'gt', 'lt', 'gte', 'lte'.
   *   -label: The label (if applicable) to appear for the element. The default
   *     is to use the term's name.
   *   -help: Help text (if applicable) to appear for the element. The default
   *     is to use the term's definition.
   *   -type: The data type: e.g. 'string' or 'numeric'. Default is 'string'.
   *   -sortable: TRUE if the element can be sorted.  FALSE if not.
   *   -elements:  If this field value is a simple scalar (i.e. string or
   *     number) then this key is not needed. But, if the 'value' of the
   *     field is an array with sub keys then those subkeys must be defined
